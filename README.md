### Hi there 👋

I'm a Data Scientist 👨‍🔬🔬 and cat father :octocat: who enjoys various kinds of PC, board and party games.

In my free time, I maintain [pydantic-yaml](https://github.com/NowanIlfideme/pydantic-yaml) & do other projects for fun.
In my paid time, I currently work at [EPAM](https://www.epam.com/).

Languages: EN (preferred) and RU

My [Personal Website](nowan.dev) is probably blank, but I'll get to it eventually...
